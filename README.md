code_typing_simulator
=====================

A web page that simulates typing in large amounts of code/text that simulates typing (with realistic time delays) and scrolls it to the top of the page

A friend of mine needed a "programmer simulator" that types in code on the screen and then scrolls the code to the top of the screen.  I have it tuned to run for a bout 9 minutes with the default text, but it can easily be adapted for other needs.  Just download, and open the 'index.html' file in a browser and hit the button.
Note: It's formatted so that it can be screen-recorded at an HD 16:9 ration, you might want to tweak the css code in index.html if you want the page layout to be different.
